# WeatherPy_VacationPy

In this exercise, Geoapify was used to collect and visualize attributes of different cities depending on their weather characteristics. WeatherPy 
contains scatter plots that visualize correlations between weather patterns and city location relative to the equator in order to determine how 
distance from the equator affects climate properties such as temperature, humidity, and wind speed.

In VacationPy, cities were mapped according to my own personal ideal weather conditions, and hotels in those ideal cities were plotted on a map 
to determine potential vacation desitination.

Note for the viewer: when exporting csv data in both notebooks, please update the file path according to your computer's file structure. In order for
this code to run correctly on my computer, the parent folder "output data" was included twice, and this could not be rectified after troubleshooting
with various learning assistants and the course instructor.
